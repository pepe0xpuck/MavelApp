        message="All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 28.0.0, 27.1.0. Examples include `com.android.support:animated-vector-drawable:28.0.0` and `com.android.support:exifinterface:27.1.0`"

        summary="Incompatible Gradle Versions"
        explanation="There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your `targetSdkVersion`)."
